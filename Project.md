1. MOS is a metal oxide semiconductor.

2. The p type transistor is attached to the n type emitter. 

3. A P transistor will be pointing in while an N transistor will not point in. 

4. The diagram is of two transistors because it has ins and outs where the voltage is flowing through. 

5. A NOT gate takes 2 transistors. 

6. You need 2 gates and 2 transistors. 

IB- I am proud that I am learning about these kinds of things.
